FairChains working tree
=======================

FairChains is an extension for the [FairCoin Core wallet](https://github.com/faircoin/faircoin.git) that implements the [Omnilayer](https://www.omnilayer.org/) protocol. It also provides a tool to create a new blockchain without the need to compile a new version of the wallet binary.

More information about FairCoin can be found [here](https://fair-coin.org/)

Please note: add `--disable-tests --disable-bench` to the configure options because test and benchmarks are not implemented yet.
