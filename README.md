FairCoin proof-of-cooperation working tree
==========================================

FairCoin is the monetary base system for FairCoop. We constantly drive development of the FairCoop/FairCoin ecosystem further and shape the individual components to fit our vision: building tools to enable everyone to participate in a fair economy on a global scale.

We decided to create a new version of FairCoin which corrects issues we encountered. The old version of FairCoin relied on PoS (proof-of-stake) which cannot be considered fair, because it confers an advantage on the already rich. Therefore we needed to come up with a new way to secure the network. We call it PoC (proof-of-cooperation). This innovation will finally make FairCoin fair, secure, and sustainable.

Please note: add `--disable-tests --disable-bench` to the configure options because test and benchmarks are not implemented yet.
